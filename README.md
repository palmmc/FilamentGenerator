# Filament Generator
Create and streamline filament content by generating with templates.

## Skip the hassle!
For specific item or block types, such as equipment, the complexity can add up fast.
Using templates, you can forego most of the creation process, and just focus on customizing your feature addition!

## Create your Own!
Contributing templates is relatively simple due to the modular design of the generation and loading process.
More documentation on this will be coming soon.
